Whatevs for Ruby

FAQ
---

Q: What is Whatevs?

A: Whatevs is an important tool for simulating schemaless DBs after many years
of use.
Because all data converges to be garbage, whatevs cuts out the endless churn
and gives you garbage from the start.
But Whatevs is more than that -- Whatevs is a state of mind.
When someone asks your service for a JSON document, you could give them what
they're asking for, but, if you don't, will anything bad really happen?
Maybe you'll have an upset user or coworker to deal with, but Whatevs.

Q: Isn't this repo misnamed? It's neither a ruby file nor a json file...

A: You seem to have misunderstood the spirit of Whatevs.

Q: I get Whatevs, but what is a "Whatev" (singular)?

A: A Whatev is a random JSON document or fragment of a document.
It may be made by Whatevs-er means, so long as no two Whatevs are alike, except
when they are.
In most cases, a Whatev must be a complete and valid object, but sometimes a
Whatev can be a JSON array, or just a string, int, bool, or null.
Usually Whatevs are strings, but maybe not always -- maybe you'll see a ruby
Hash sometimes.
Whatevs, you know?

Usage

For v1, I'm working on the ruby version of Whatevs as a command line tool that
will produce a single Whatev on stdout.
We can extend and service-ize the bejeezus out of it later.
